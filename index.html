<br> Billy was the resident cowboy of my kindergarten class, coming to school each day dressed in chaps, a vest, and a cowboy hat. One morning, he told me his mother was having a baby. “I’m going to teach my little brother all the things every cowboy should know, like how to ride a horse and rope a steer”, he said. “But,” I cautioned, “what if your mother gives you a baby sister?” Billy had never considered this, and the possibility floored him. He gazed out the window for a moment before saying with resignation, “Then I’m headin’ west.”

 <br>FOUND MONEY
<br> I was third in line at the checkout, and the lady at the cashier was purchasing basic items. Two cans of cat food, a can of tuna, a loaf of bread, a quart of milk, a package of cookies. Her money was in her hand as the cashier gave her the total. She was 86 cents short. She checked her purse to not avail. “I can put

A HAPPY MEAL
<br> We recently lost our beloved dog Benny to cancer. In the year after her diagnosis, we spoiled him with attention and food. A favourite treat was two plain fast-food cheeseburgers. The day after Benny left us, I went to the chain restaurant for lunch – chicken nuggets for me, but this time, no burgers. When I got home. I found in the bag my nuggets and plain double cheeseburger. The receipt showed only nuggets. I was stunned to tears, then laughter, when I realized Benny has bought us lunch together one last time.
